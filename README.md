## 🔐 How to Get API Keys

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to build something that reflects my backend expertise, is deployable, integrates secure payments, and simulates a real-world product. TradeX was created to challenge myself and showcase what I can build as a full-stack developer — all features from scratch and deployed on scalable cloud services.
